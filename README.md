# MyRPG by ikerpacheco, Aymeric Fisselier and Eduardo Jarr√≠n

Original rpg-type game. Inspired in the graphics and gameplay of Pokemon. This is by far the longest project of the first year. We've dedicated so many hours trying to make our game the best possible.

### HOW TO RUN

- Clone the repository.
- Compile the game with "make re".
- Execute it with "./my_rpg".
